            <h2>To my loving Enjie,</h2>
            <p> I can’t believe it’s already been a month since we started dating! It feels like time has flown by, and I’ve loved every moment of it.This month has been amazing. From our late-night talks and all the laughs we’ve shared to the quiet moments where just being with you was enough, it’s all been so special. You’ve brought so much happiness into my life, and I can’t help but smile whenever I think about you. I love how you make me feel—loved, understood, and appreciated. Your kindness and humor brighten even my toughest days. The way you listen and care means the world to me, and it’s in those little everyday moments that I fall for you even more.

I remember your confession and how nervous you we're. Every moment since has been filled with wonderful memories. Whether we’re out having fun or just hanging out together, I cherish every second with you.Thank you for being patient, understanding, and for making me feel so special every day. You’ve shown me what it means to really care for someone, and I’m so grateful for that. Here’s to our first month and many more to come. I can’t wait to see where our journey takes us and to make even more memories together. Happy monthsary, boss. I adore you more than I can say.</p>

                <p1>Being with you at school is like having my own little slice of happiness every day. From the way you make me laugh in the mini forest or even wherever we stay inside the campus, all the simple things and moments with you that I treasure the most. Whether we're sharing notes and answers or just hanging out in the usual place, your presence brightens my day and makes everything more enjoyable. I love how we navigate the school day together, making memories that I know I'll cherish forever. You're not just my boyfriend; you're my favorite part of school, and being with you makes every day better than the last and you're the reason I look forward for tomorrow.</p1>

              <h3>Video Calls</h3>

                <img src="images/photo6.jpg" alt="Photo 6">
                 <p2>I was thinking about all those times we've spent on video calls together. Remember that time when we stayed up way too late, even when the time we talked all day long just playing some games (hind ko na alam tawag dun) just talking about everything and nothing at all? Your laughter echoed through the screen, and I swear, for a moment, it felt like you were right here beside me. And then there are those quiet moments when we'd just gaze at each other, soaking in the fact that even though we're apart, our hearts are so close. Those video calls aren't just calls; they're like snapshots of our relationship, little memories we're creating despite the distance. I cherish every second we get to see each other, even through a screen, because it's in those moments that I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my life.</p2>

                <p3>I love you like I love the sea. You bring me peace and excitement, just like the ocean does. Every day, my feelings for you get stronger, and there's always something new and amazing to discover about you. Being with you feels as comforting as the sound of waves, and my love for you is as endless as the sea. I love watching the sunset with you as it gives me peace as you do. Thank you for finding a way in order to make things happen just to make me happy. I aapreciate it.</p3>

                <p4>I've been thinking about CBME night and all the sweet things you said to me. You kept telling me how beautiful I looked and how amazing I was, and it really meant a lot to me. I know I didn't say much at the time, but I want you to know how much I appreciated every word. Your compliments made me feel so special and loved. Thank you for making that night unforgettable.</p4>

                <p5>I wanted to share something with you. Sometimes, when you’re just doing your thing—whether it’s playing guitar, talking to someonelse, or even just walking—I find myself staring at you. It’s because, in those moments, you look so incredible to me even when you're jolly and acting like a child.

There’s a certain way you focus, a light in your eyes, that’s so captivating (true toh, walang halong plastic, sa staring contest natin noh HAHAH). It makes me realize how lucky I am to be with someone as passionate and amazing as you.

When I look at you like that, it feels like I’m seeing the real you. Every little moment we share makes me appreciate you even more.

You bring so much joy into my life, and I’m so grateful for all the time we spend together. I love you more than words can say.</p5>
